# Virtubase ⏹
Work in progress VRChat asset database for creators.
### Core Ideas 📝
- Central user-contributed repository for VRC creator's gumroad and booth links.
- Lightweight and quick, build for the modern web on the latest version of Remix.JS
- Quick queries through MongoDB (Subject to change, might host my own)
- Searchable tagging for species, gender, etc, and 18+ filter.
- Curated asset list, popularity, etc.

Virtubase is still in its early stages of drafting, serving as a way for me to learn more UI/UX related design ideas and further researching databses and how to effectively implement them into modern web frameworks.

### Tech Stack 💻
- Remix.JS 2.0
- Node.JS
- MongoDB (tenative)
